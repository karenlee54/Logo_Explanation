# Assignment #8 (Final Project Part B)  

This week's assignment is a continuation of the Final Project for the class, which should fulfill the requirements listed below.

## Part 1.

Start working on code for your final project, making use of *object-oriented programming* (OOP).  Your code should include at least one object `class` for the primary element in your program, such as the main player in a game.  It should also demonstrate programming the movement or other behaviors of the object(s) by using their *attributes* and *methods* with the "dot notation".

For example, an object in your program would likely include at least the `x` and `y` attributes for placement on the screen and methods to update and draw the object, like `update(self)` and `draw(self)`.  

In addition, your code should make use of a  variable such as `program_state` to structure your program into at least 3 different states or behaviors.  For example, a game might have a 'START' state, 'PLAY' state, and 'WIN'/'LOOSE' states.  Pretty much any kind of program can begin with a splash screen and end with a "reveal" such as a surprise message or animation.  The initial state of your program can be a splash screen that incorporates on-screen text with the program title and your name. 

## Part 2.  

Incorporate a sequence of secondary elements into your program as a List of objects.  For example, you may have other characters in a game, or objects that the primary player interacts with, or background animation elements (drops of rain or snow, stars in the sky, fish  in the sea, etc.)

Traverse the list you have created with a loop and draw each element in the sequence. You can draw the objects using images, p5 drawing functions, or a combination of both. 

Add animation and/or interaction to the objects in your program.  The interaction could include mouse or keyboard input (such as controlling the spaceship in Space Invaders game), and/or interaction between the primary and secondary elements (such as the spaceship shooting down the invaders).

## Part 3.  

Include and utilize a child object in your program that inherits some variables and methods from a parent object (use of *inheritance*), while overriding some methods with its own (use of *polymorphism*).  

As the simplest example, you could create a generic `class Sprite` and then create another class that inherits Sprite attributes and methods. Then, you can add some additional attributes and/or methods to this child object class.

## Part 4. [Extra-credit]

Use original ideas and graphic assets as part of your program to the extent possible.  For example, add a description such as "original art by ..."  or something similar to your graphics or in code comments, to make it clear.  

In general, any additional effort and use of programming techniques beyond the project requirements can be considered extra credit.

---

Please **be ready to present a functional demo of your final project during our last class** on week 12.  The due date for the project is set to be after that week, but your code should be functional and close to finished by the morning of our last class.

As the Final Assignment (Part C of the Final Project), I will ask everyone to create a short video that is a screen-capture walkthrough of the project you've created. If you feel that you have finished the project completely by the last class, please feel free to get started on the video ahead of time.  The video may come in handy when you are presenting your project in class.
